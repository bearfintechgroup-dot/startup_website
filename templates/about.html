     OUR STORY / ORIGIN
================================ -->
<section class="about-section fade-in delay-1">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        BEAR FINTECH GROUP was founded on the belief that technology and financial insight can be tools
        for empowerment. The company began with the vision of <strong>George Idoko</strong>—a professional football
        athlete competing with the Calgary Stampeders, and a Computer Science graduate from the
        University of Saskatchewan.
    </p>

    <p>
        Balancing athletics at a high level and academic excellence demanded discipline, clarity under
        pressure, and long-term strategy. These same principles now guide the products and solutions
        developed at BEAR FINTECH GROUP.
    </p>

    <p>
        What started as a personal drive to build better financial and digital tools has grown into a
        multi-disciplinary fintech and technology initiative committed to shaping the future of
        digital experiences.
