        <div class="about-column">
            <p>
                <strong>George Idoko</strong> created Bear Fintech Group with the belief that powerful tools
                should be accessible to everyone. His journey began with a deep curiosity for
                <strong>investing, financial markets, and technological problem-solving</strong>—areas that
                continue to shape the company’s mission.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a professional athlete drafted from the
                <strong>University of Saskatchewan</strong>, experience has refined the discipline, vision, and
                strategic mindset that later became the driving force behind Bear Fintech Group.
            </p>

            <p>
                The passion for eliminating real-world barriers through technology inspired the foundation
                of a company focused on intelligent, user-centered digital experiences.
